This is a collection of tools I have used over the years collected together.

## Signal Catcher

`SignalCatch` catches `SIGINT` and `SIGTERM` signals and sets
`SignalCatch.kill` to `True`.

## Simple Processes

```python
def func():
    # some simple process that does something
    for _ in range(10):
        print(".", end="")
        time.sleep(0.1)
    print("")

def test_process():
    p = SimpleProcess()
    p.start(func)
    print(p)
    p.join(timeout=2.0) # if not ended in 2 sec, will terminate() the process
```

## Storage

```python
from slurm import storage

pick = storage.read("file.pickle")
yaml = storage.read("file.yaml")
json = storage.read("file.json")
json = storage.read("file", "json")


data = [1,2,3,4]
storage.write("tom.pickle", data)
storage.write("bob.json", data)
storage.write("guess.file", data, "yml")
```

Also, for YAML files, you can put comments in:

```python
info = {
    "a": 1
}

num = 5
comm = f"""
# hello {num} dogs!!
# there
# big boy
"""
storage.write("t.yaml", info, comments=comm)
```

which will produce:

```yaml
# hello 5 dogs!!
# there
# big boy

a: 1
```

## Network

```python
from slurm import network

ip = network.get_ip()
print(ip)
```

## Sleep Rate

Will sleep for a prescribed amount of time inside of a loop
irregardless of how long the loop takes

```python
from slurm.rate import Rate

rate = Rate(10)  # let loop run at 10 Hz

while True:
    # do some processing
    rate.sleep()
```

## Files

```python
from slurm.files import rmdir, mkdir, run, rm, find

mkdir("some/path")
rmdir("some/path")
rm("/path/file.txt")
rm(["path/a.txt", "path/2/b.txt", "path/3/c.txt"])

find("/path/to/somewhere", "file_to_find") # -> list
find("/path/to/somewhere", "*.html") # -> list

run("ls -alh") # -> output
```
