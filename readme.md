This is a collection of tools I have used over the years collected together.

## Signal Catcher

`SignalCatch` catches `SIGINT` and `SIGTERM` signals and sets
`SignalCatch.kill` to `True`.

```python
from slurm import SignalCatch

sig = SignalCatch()

while True:
    if sig.kill == True:
        exit(0)
```

## Simple Processes

```python
from slurm import SimpleProcess

def func():
    # some simple process that does something
    for _ in range(10):
        print(".", end="")
        time.sleep(0.1)
    print("")

def test_process():
    p = SimpleProcess()
    p.start(func)
    print(p)
    p.join(timeout=2.0) # if not ended in 2 sec, will terminate() the process
```

## Storage

```python
from slurm import storage

pick = storage.read("file.pickle")
yaml = storage.read("file.yaml")
json = storage.read("file.json")
json = storage.read("file", "json")


data = [1,2,3,4]
storage.write("tom.pickle", data)
storage.write("bob.json", data)
storage.write("guess.file", data, "yml")
```

Also, for YAML files, you can put comments in:

```python
info = {
    "a": 1
}

num = 5
comm = f"""
# hello {num} dogs!!
# there
# big boy
"""
storage.write("t.yaml", info, comments=comm)
```

which will produce:

```yaml
# hello 5 dogs!!
# there
# big boy

a: 1
```

## Science Storage

Over the years I have collected a lot of data, but not completely documented
the sensors or their settings. I am trying to setup a data file that can:

- use primarly standard python libraries to read (exception `dill` for `namedtuples`)
- self documenting with info and `namedtuples`
- can use `gzip` for compression of large files

```python
from slurm import scistorage
from collections import namedtuple

Sensor = namedtuple("Sensor","x y z")

# document sensor setting in this data file
info = {
    "TFmini": {
        "min": 0.3,
        "max": 12.0,
        "fov_deg": 4.6,
        "units": "m"
    },
    "LSM6DSOX": {
        "accel": {
            "range": (-4,4),
            "units": "g"
        },
        "gyro": {
            "range": (-2000,2000),
            "units": "dps"
        }
    },
    "LIS3MDL": {
        "range": (-4,4), # 4 gauss = 400 uT
        "units": "gauss"
    },
    "DPS310": {
        "sensors": ("temperature", "pressure")
    }
}

data = [] # some data stored in an array or deque
for i in range(100):
    data.append(Sensor(i,i,i)) # pretend you got some data from a sensor


scistorage.write(info, data, "data.dil.gz") # *.gz uses gzip compression

bag = scistorage.read("data.dil.gz")
print(bag["info"])
print(bag["data"])
```

## Network

```python
from slurm import network

print(network.get_ip()) # -> ip_address
print(network.host()) # -> (hostname, ip_address)
```

## Sleep Rate

Will sleep for a prescribed amount of time inside of a loop
irregardless of how long the loop takes

```python
from slurm import Rate

rate = Rate(10)  # let loop run at 10 Hz

while True:
    # do some processing
    rate.sleep()
```

## Files

```python
from slurm.files import rmdir, mkdir, run, rm, find

mkdir("some/path")
rmdir("some/path")
rm("/path/file.txt")
rm(["path/a.txt", "path/2/b.txt", "path/3/c.txt"])

find("/path/to/somewhere", "file_to_find") # -> list
find("/path/to/somewhere", "*.html") # -> list

run("ls -alh") # -> output
```
